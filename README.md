+ [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/JonGano/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/basic%20javascript%20projects/TicTacToe)

**Calculator**: Simple calculator with the multipy, divide, add and subtract operators that also allows for decimal point equations.

**Pizza Menu**: A pizza menu that can be used to create an order from the checkbox options and return a price total.

**Tic-Tac-Toe**: A game against the comtupter. Moves made by the computer are generated with the js's Math.random method in correlation with conditional loops. A line illustration across the winning three in a row is generated by a js function that utilizes the canvas html tag and is accompanied with music indicating a win, or another music file is played anouncing a scratch.
